# {{ page.title }}

I’ve just pushed [v4.3.3 of inuitcss to GitHub](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css)
which included some new image classes—thanks to [Anderson Juhasc](https://github.com/Anderson-Juhasc)—and
a marginalia object, courtesy of [Sacha Schmid](https://github.com/RadLikeWhoa).

## Image classes

The additional image classes allow us to now position images left, right or
centrally, as well as some classes I added which can be used to size images
vertically to keep them on your baseline.

You can [browse the code](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/blob/master/base/_images.scss)
or [view a demo](http://jsfiddle.net/inuitcss/yMtur/embedded/result,html,css).

## Marginalia object

[Marginalia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia) is a ‘proper’ term for
notes and asides often included in the margin of a piece of work (usually a book).
Sacha Schmid built and submitted a marginalia object for inuitcss which got
included as part of v4.3.3.
